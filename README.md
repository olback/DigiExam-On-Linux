# DigiExam on Linux

Yes, you can run DigiExam on your Linux machine. How? You might ask.
Well, after tinkering arround with Wine on Ubuntu 17.04 LTS I've made it work.

#### So what? Whats the problem?
The problem is, DigiExam is a program used by schools to make sure students don't cheat when they're writing a test/essay. Running Running DigiExam on Linux with wine allows you to ALT-TAB or even run it in windowed mode. So DigiExam is not in fullscreen and even if it is, you can still ALT-TAB.

#### Eh, nobody uses Linux anyways, right?
No... Some schools allow you to bring your own laptop and use it instead of the computer provided by the school. 
So if a student brings a laptop with Linux, they could easily cheat. ALT-Tabbing in to a browser to check facts or spelling would be easy.

#### But only allow laptops provided by the school?
Could be that simple, but since 99% of the teachers have no idea what computer models are used by the school, so that wouldn't work either. This solution would not allow students with their own Windows laptop or Macs, not ideal.

#### Make sure the student uses a Windows or Mac laptop?
Some Linux-Mint themes look almost exactly like Windows, would be easy to trick a supervisor/teacher.
Other Linux distros such as ElementaryOS looks a lot like MacOS.

#### What's the ideal fix?
DigiExam either has to either make a version that works nativly on Linux or make sure that it cannot run on Linux in a Wine environment. How? Well, thats up to the DigiExam developers.
